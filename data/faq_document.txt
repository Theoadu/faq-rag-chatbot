Employee Onboarding Process
New hires must complete all onboarding paperwork within 3 business days of their start date. This includes tax forms, direct deposit setup, and acknowledgment of company policies. Failure to complete onboarding on time may delay payroll processing.

Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy
Full-time employees accrue 15 days of PTO per year, prorated for partial years. PTO begins accruing on the first day of employment and is available for use after 90 days. Unused PTO does not roll over into the next calendar year and is forfeited.

Remote Work Guidelines
Employees may work remotely up to 3 days per week with manager approval. Remote work requests must be submitted via the HR portal at least 5 business days in advance. Employees are expected to maintain core collaboration hours (10 AM–3 PM local time) regardless of location.

Health Insurance Enrollment
New employees have 30 days from their start date to enroll in health, dental, and vision insurance. Coverage begins on the first day of the month following 30 days of employment. Changes outside of open enrollment are only permitted during qualifying life events.

Expense Reimbursement Procedure
Employees must submit expense reports within 14 days of incurring the expense. Receipts are required for all expenses over $25. Reimbursements are processed biweekly and appear in the next scheduled payroll cycle.

Code of Conduct
All employees must adhere to the company’s Code of Conduct, which includes policies on harassment, discrimination, data privacy, and conflict of interest. Violations may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

Performance Reviews
Performance reviews occur twice a year: in June and December. Employees receive a self-assessment form 2 weeks prior and must complete it before their manager meeting. Goals should align with departmental OKRs.

Parental Leave Policy
Eligible employees receive 12 weeks of paid parental leave following the birth, adoption, or foster placement of a child. Leave must be taken within 12 months of the qualifying event and requires 30 days’ advance notice when possible.

Security and Data Handling
Employees must complete annual security training. Sensitive data must never be stored on personal devices or unapproved cloud services. Report any suspected security incidents to IT immediately.

Professional Development Budget
Each full-time employee receives a $1,000 annual stipend for courses, certifications, or conferences. Requests must be pre-approved by your manager and submitted through the L&D portal.

Workplace Accommodations
Employees requiring accommodations due to disability or religious practice should contact HR. Requests are reviewed within 5 business days, and reasonable accommodations are provided per legal requirements.

Exit Interviews
Departing employees are required to complete an exit interview with HR. This helps us improve our workplace. Final paychecks include all accrued but unused PTO if permitted by state law.

Dress Code
Our dress code is business casual. Team members meeting clients should wear professional attire. On “Casual Fridays,” jeans and company-branded shirts are acceptable.

Overtime Policy
Non-exempt employees must receive prior approval for overtime work. Overtime is compensated at 1.5x the regular hourly rate as required by law. Unauthorized overtime may result in disciplinary action.

Holiday Schedule
The company observes 10 paid holidays annually, including New Year’s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. A full list is published each November.

Employee Referral Program
Refer a qualified candidate who is hired and stays for 90 days, and you’ll receive a $1,000 bonus. Submit referrals through the internal careers portal with a brief note about your connection.
